    "As computer scientists started to develop various algorithms for a solutions, they needed a way to classify the effectiveness of their algorithms, and they also required a way to prove that a new algorithm is better than the old by mathematical proof & analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to this, three notations methods were developed:\n",
    "1. Big - O Notation (the worst case scenario)\n",
    "2. Big - Theta Notation (the average case scenario)\n",
    "3. Big- Omega Notation (the best case scenario)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we analyze an algorithm we can look at all three scenarios and see their effectiveness. The main notation that we will focus will be the Big-O Notation. We focus on the Big-O because it shows us that at worst our algorithm will perform at X, and if X is better than our previous algorithm, it is **_definitely_** better.\n",

    "\n",
    "We use Big-O Notation for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithm Proof**: To prove that our algorithm A is better than algorithm B, we must have a proof that our Big-O notation is better\n",
    "2. **Measure Performance, Run-time, or Disk Usage**: Our algorithms are designed to solve problems; however, reaching the solutions must not be feasible due to time or disk-space constraints\n",
    "3. **Mathematically Formalizing our Algorithms**: Different hardware will output different runtimes; therefore, we needed a formal mathematical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O is Classified with a Notation of: \n",

    "O(f(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "-- where f(x) can be various mathematical functions that describes behaviour of our algorithm's effectiveness.\n",
